## Summary
Given an existing code-base of an RSS feed, refactor the app to meet Material Design specifications. The focus of the project was to improve the design and not worry about the state of the internal code. [original code](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code). 

## Features
* Add a collapsing toolbar using `CoordinatorLayout`.
* Improve layout across various screen sizes using resource qualifiers.
* Fix margin and padding.
* Improve colors.
* Improve text readability.
* Improve arrangement of UI elements for natural interaction.

## Configuration  
* Tested on Android API 24.
* Clone and run `XYZReader` configuration.

## Notes  
* I have since improved my design skills even further, please check out my most recent app [Earthquake Feed](https://github.com/seth-wat/Earthquake-Feed/edit/master/README.md).  
* My usage of git in this repository isn't great. I'm actively improving my git best-practices visible in my more recent repositories.
