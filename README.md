# Summary
Given an existing code-base of an RSS feed, refactor the app to meet Material Design specifications. The focus of the project was strictly on design and not on improving the existing codebase. The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code).

## Features
* Add a collapsing toolbar using `CoordinatorLayout`.
* Improve layout across various screen sizes using resource qualifiers.
* Fix margin and padding using Material Design spec.
* Improve colors using [Material Design color spec](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette).
* Improve text readability: color and size.
* Improve arrangement of UI elements for natural interaction.

## Configuration  
* Tested on Android API 24.
* Clone and run `XYZReader` configuration.

## Notes  
* I have since improved my design skills even further, please check out my most recent app [Earthquake Feed](https://github.com/seth-wat/Earthquake-Feed/edit/master/README.md).  
* My usage of git in this repository isn't great. I'm actively improving my git best-practices if you examine my more recent repositories.
